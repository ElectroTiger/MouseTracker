Author: kravitzlab
Date: June 23 2016
Purpose: given multiple files with timestamps(first column of a csv file) corresponding to the
single pellet retrieved by a mouse, the application plots rows of timestamps separate for each file(mouse).
Application extracts only common full 12 hours daytime and nighttime intervals. User can define what were
the nighttime and daytime hours in the experiment. User can also define the time intervals between
pellets retrieved separating meals(for example if a mouse retrieved last pellet more than 30 min ago,
the next pellet retrieved after that period, will not be considered the same meal). User can also specify
what size in grams is a meal, and what size of pellets(in grams) was used during the experiment.
Then, according to the given parameters, the application plots lines connecting timestamps that are considered 
a meal. Each horizontal line is a meal, each vertical line is a timestamp.
'''

'''
Requirements: Anaconda(Python3.5)
Tested on Windows7.
For MacOS: To be continued... For now there is a problem with the user interface.
It works if the user replaces the src variable(line102) in this code with the path to the folder 
containing csv files(src="path"), and comments out lines related to GUI.
